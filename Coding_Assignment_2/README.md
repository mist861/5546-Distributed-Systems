# 5546-0002 Coding Assignment 2: FIFO-Total Ordered Multicast

This is Coding Assignment 2 for Group 4 in 5545 Distributed Computing Section 2.
This uses the provided skeleton code, modifies it for FIFO/Total-Ordered Multicast that does not use a designated sequencer.

## Execution:

* fifo-total.py: python3 fifo-total.py
    * This executes the multicast with the original list of events.
* fifo-total_extended.py: python3 fifo-total_extended.py
    * This executes the multicast with an extended list of events.
